💎 Vibeathon Winning Prompt: The Bug Buster (Classy Tech Edition)

THEME: Agentverse: Minimalist Autonomous Tech.
TARGET FRAMEWORK: Full-Stack React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS (Ensure Tailwind is configured to use the custom colors below).

PHASE 1: UI/UX & VIBE (Modern & Awesome)

AESTHETIC & ANIMATION RULES (CRITICAL):
1. Color Palette: Use a Deep Slate/Charcoal background (#171923). Primary Accent: Subtle Aqua/Teal (#00E5C0). Secondary Accent/Success: Muted Gold/Warm Yellow (#FFD700).
2. Typography: Use a clean, modern Sans-Serif font (e.g., Inter, if available).
3. Pre-Landing Page (Maximum Animation):
    * Effect: Full-screen for 5 seconds. Must display a Layered Grid Manifestation animation (abstract data flow). Use a 3D-like parallax effect where fine grid lines (in the Aqua/Teal accent) move at slightly different speeds.
    * Text Reveal: The text "Initializing Bug Buster Core Logic..." must use a fluid, staggered scale-up/fade-in animation, perfectly timed with the grid settling.
    * Transition: A smooth, cinematic Cross-Fade to the main dashboard.
4. Dashboard Layout: Bento Grid (70/30). Apply Subtle Drop Shadows and soft corners (rounded-xl) to all panel cards.
5. Motion (Fluidity):
    * Bento Panel Hover: When hovering over the Diagnostic or Activity panels, the card must execute a Subtle Hover Lift (translateY(-2px)) and the border must pulse with a Soft Aqua/Teal Glow (use a transition-all class).
    * Chat Messages: Implement a Fluid Fade-In and Scale-Up animation (scale-0.98 to scale-1.0) on all incoming agent messages.
    * Hypotheses Card: The hypothesis details must use a smooth CSS transition when expanding/collapsing (progressive disclosure).
    * Activity Log: The scrolling log must feature a top and bottom blur/fade mask to indicate continuous data flow off-screen (professional display).

PHASE 2: CORE AUTONOMY & MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

TASK: Maintain the fully functional, reliable Multi-Agent System logic. Ensure the agents' output directly drives the new UI components.
AGENT ROLE REFINEMENT (Tone and Output):
1. Empathy Agent (💙): Must adopt a highly professional, calm, and supportive Co-Pilot tone. Tone should be helpful but refined. (No emojis, per design review).
2. Diagnostic Agent (🧠): Output the ranked JSON array to specifically populate the expandable Bento Grid card.
3. Execution Agent (⚡): Must feed real-time entries to the Scrolling Activity Log and output the final fix as a clean, code-highlighted Diff.
MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMATS (MUST BE VISIBLE):
1. Structured Bug Report: JSON card in the main chat (post-Empathy Agent).
2. Hypotheses List: Ranked, expandable list in the dedicated side panel.
3. Activity Log: Real-time stream of RUN: and INSPECT: actions in the other dedicated side panel.
4. Git-style Code Diff: Final output in the chat:
    * Additions (+): Highlighted in the Aqua/Teal accent color.
    * Deletions (-): Highlighted in a Soft Red/Coral color.

PHASE 3: EXECUTION INSTRUCTION

DELIVERABLE: Scaffold the entire project focusing first on the New Pre-Loader and the Main Dashboard CSS/Animations. Then integrate the existing multi-agent logic (using the fallback system) to prove the visual pipeline is working seamlessly with the fluid effects.
START THE PROJECT. THE FINAL OUTPUT MUST BE A USABLE, HIGHLY STYLIZED MVP THAT DEMONSTRATES ALL CUSTOM ANIMATION, FONT, AND COLOR RULES ABOVE.
