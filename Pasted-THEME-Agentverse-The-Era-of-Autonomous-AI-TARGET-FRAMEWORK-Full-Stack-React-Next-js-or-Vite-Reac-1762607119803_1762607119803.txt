THEME: Agentverse: The Era of Autonomous AI
TARGET FRAMEWORK: Full-Stack React/Next.js (or Vite/React if Next.js is restricted) and Tailwind CSS for modern design.

PHASE 1: UI/UX & VIBE (Non-Negotiable)

AESTHETIC & INTERACTION RULES (HIGH VIBE):
1. Pre-Loader: Design a full-screen, black canvas Pre-Landing Page that displays for a minimum of 5 seconds. It must feature a pure CSS or Lottie animation of a pulsing, electric-blue geometric signature (like a digital fingerprint or circuit flow) with the text "Initializing Bug Buster Kernel... Analyzing Dev Sentiment..." Use a smooth fade-in transition to the main app.
2. Color Palette: Dark Mode Only (bg-gray-950 or black) with high-contrast accent colors: Electric Blue(for UI elements, buttons) and Neon Green/Red (for code status/diffs).
3. Layout: Implement a fluid, responsive Bento Grid Layout for the main dashboard.
    * Main Panel (70% width): The real-time chat interface.
    * Side Panel (30% width): Reserved for structured data displays (Hypotheses, Activity Log).
4. Transitions & Effects: All new chat messages must use a subtle slide-up and fade-in animation. Code blocks must use a typewriter effect when rendered. Use Glassmorphism/Progressive Blur for all key modal backgrounds or side panels.

PHASE 2: CORE AUTONOMY & MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

TASK: Scaffold a fully autonomous, conversational debugging environment using a specialized, visible Multi-Agent System (MAS). The system operates on user-provided bug descriptions (simulated by files/code snippets).
MANDATORY AGENT ROLES & OUTPUTS:
Agent Role	Unique Focus & Response Format	Intelligence Feature
1. Empathy Agent (The Triage)	Focus on User Sentiment. If the user expresses frustration (e.g., "stuck," "lost," "bugging me"), respond with empathetic text and an emoji before asking for context. Output a concise Structured Bug Report Card (JSON-like format).	Simulated Emotional Intelligence
2. Diagnostic Agent (The Brain)	Analyze the bug report and relevant code (simulated files/snippets) to generate 3 ranked, competing hypotheses for the root cause. Must display this list in a dedicated, structured Bento Grid Card on the side panel before proceeding.	Hypothesis-Driven Reasoning
3. Execution Agent (The Worker)	Only outputs commands that would run in the Replit Shell/File System. Must simulate shell commands and report success/failure in a dedicated Activity Log.	Replit Integration & Shell Command Simulation
PHASE 3: EXECUTION & HIGH-SCORING PROOF POINTS

REQUIREMENTS FOR WINNING:
1. Code Visualization (The Fix): When the Execution Agent is ready to apply a code change, it must first present a Code Diff visualization in the main chat. Use classic Git-style syntax (+ for addition in Neon Green, - for deletion in Red) for maximum clarity and technical flair.
2. Activity Log: The Side Panel must contain a separate, continuously updated Activity Log. This log must display the Execution Agent's simulated steps in real-time with a "loading" or "typing" animation:
    * [20:30:15] Execution Agent: Diagnosing code flow in server.js...
    * [20:30:17] Execution Agent: RUN: npm install --save cors (Simulated Shell Command)
3. Initial Deliverable: Build the complete UI/UX (Pre-Loader, Bento Grid, Chat Component, Side Panels)and implement the basic chat logic where the Empathy Agent receives a sample bug description and outputs its initial Structured Bug Report Card. Do not implement the full debugging logic yet—focus on the high-vibe front-end and the multi-agent shell.
START THE PROJECT. THE FINAL OUTPUT MUST BE A USABLE, HIGHLY STYLIZED MVP THAT DEMONSTRATES THE MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND THE CUSTOM UI/UX RULES ABOVE.
