THEME: Agentverse: Minimalist Autonomous Tech. TARGET FRAMEWORK: Full-Stack React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS. (Ensure Tailwind is configured to use custom colors and animations).

PHASE 1: UI/UX & HIGH-END AESTHETIC (The New Vibe)

AESTHETIC & ANIMATION RULES (CRITICAL, MUST BE AWESOME):

Color Palette: Use a soft, high-contrast, professional palette.

Background: Very Dark Slate/Charcoal (e.g., #0F172A or #171923).

Primary Accent (Success/Highlight): A sophisticated Teal/Aqua (#00E5C0).

Secondary/Tertiary: Muted, subtle grays and whites for text and separators.

Typography: Use a Clean, Modern Sans-Serif font (e.g., Inter, Source Sans Pro) for all text. Ensure excellent kerning and readability.

Pre-Landing Page (Maximized Smooth Motion):

Concept: Subtle, Continuous Background Motion. The full screen should feature a slow, ambient animation—e.g., a low-opacity layered 3D mesh or geometric particle field that perpetually, smoothly drifts and warps in the background. This animation must be non-distracting but continuous.

Text Reveal: The text "Initializing Bug Buster Core Logic..." must use a staggered letter-by-letter or word-by-word fade-in and scale-up animation (not a typewriter effect).

Duration/Transition: Must last 5 seconds, ending with a super-smooth, slow Cross-Fade to the main dashboard.

Dashboard Layout: Bento Grid (70/30). Apply Soft, Subtle Drop Shadows and rounded-xl corners to all panel cards for a layered, premium look.

Micro-Interactions (Fluidity):

Bento Panel Hover: When hovering, the card must execute a Smooth 3D Press/Lift (scale(1.01) and soft shadow change) and have a Subtle Accent Border Pulse (Teal/Aqua).

Chat Messages: Implement a Fluid Fade-In and Scale-Up animation (scale-0.98 to scale-1.0) on all agent messages.

Hypotheses Card: Must be expandable (Accordion style) with a smooth CSS transition for height and opacity when revealing details.

PHASE 2: CORE AUTONOMY & AGENT LOGIC

TASK: Maintain the fully functional, reliable Multi-Agent System logic and the existing prompt structure (Empathy → Diagnostic → Execution).

AGENT RESPONSE INTEGRATION:

Empathy Agent: Maintain the professional, supportive Co-Pilot tone.

Activity Log (Execution Agent): The scrolling log must feature a top and bottom blur/fade mask to indicate continuous data flow.

Code Diff Visualization: Use Aqua/Teal (+ additions) and Soft Red/Coral (- deletions) for the diff colors, maintaining the high-contrast look within the code block.

PHASE 3: EXECUTION INSTRUCTION

DELIVERABLE: Build the complete UI, prioritizing the Pre-Loader and the Dashboard's fluid animations and sophisticated styling. Then integrate the existing multi-agent logic (using the reliable fallback system) to prove the visual pipeline is working seamlessly with the high-end effects.

START THE PROJECT. THE FINAL OUTPUT MUST BE A USABLE, HIGHLY STYLIZED MVP THAT DEMONSTRATES ALL CUSTOM ANIMATION, FONT, AND COLOR RULES ABOVE. IT MUST EMULATE THE SENSE OF MOTION AND SOPHISTICATION SEEN IN THE REFERENCE URL.
